# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SafetyAI is a comprehensive safety reporting analysis web application that integrates with the existing DATwise EHS platform. The system leverages Google Gemini 2.5's multimodal AI capabilities to automatically process, analyze, and categorize safety incident reports from multiple input sources including documents, images, and audio. The primary objective is to transform manual safety incident processing from a 2-3 day manual workflow into a 30-second automated intelligent analysis system, achieving 90% reduction in processing time while improving accuracy and generating actionable safety recommendations.

## Build and Development Commands

### Building the Solution
- Open `SafetyAI.sln` in Visual Studio 2017 or later
- Build using Visual Studio: Build â†’ Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
- Command line: `MSBuild SafetyAI.sln /p:Configuration=Release`

### Running Tests
- Use Visual Studio Test Explorer or MSTest runner
- Test project: `SafetyAI.Tests` with MSTest framework
- Run all tests: Test â†’ Run All Tests in Visual Studio
- Command line: `VSTest.Console.exe SafetyAI.Tests\bin\Debug\SafetyAI.Tests.dll`

### Running the Application
- Set `SafetyAI.Web` as startup project in Visual Studio
- Run with F5 or Ctrl+F5
- Default URL: `http://localhost:8080/`
- Requires IIS Express or IIS

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: .NET Framework 4.8, ASP.NET Web Forms
- **Database**: Entity Framework 6.4 with SQL Server
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.5 API for multimodal processing
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3, JavaScript ES6+

### Project Structure
- **SafetyAI.Models**: Entities, DTOs, and enums for data models
- **SafetyAI.Data**: Entity Framework DbContext, repositories, and data access layer
- **SafetyAI.Services**: Business logic services including Gemini API integration
- **SafetyAI.Web**: ASP.NET Web Forms application with UI pages
- **SafetyAI.Tests**: MSTest unit tests for all layers

### Core Architecture Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction with `IRepository<T>` and specific repositories
- **Unit of Work**: Transaction management via `IUnitOfWork` 
- **Dependency Injection**: Service registration in `DependencyConfig.cs`
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation with interface-based services

### Key Services
- **GeminiAPIClient**: Multimodal AI processing (documents, images, audio, chat)
- **DocumentProcessor**: File validation and content extraction
- **SafetyAnalyzer**: Safety incident analysis and risk assessment
- **AudioProcessor**: Audio transcription and safety term extraction

### Database Design
- **SafetyReport**: Main entity for uploaded safety documents
- **AnalysisResult**: AI analysis results linked to safety reports  
- **Recommendation**: Safety recommendations generated from analysis
- Optimized with composite indexes for common query patterns

## Configuration Requirements

### Database Connection
Update `Web.config` connectionString:
```xml
<add name="SafetyAIConnection" 
     connectionString="Data Source=YOUR_SERVER;Initial Catalog=SafetyAI;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True" 
     providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
```

### Gemini API Configuration
Set API key in `Web.config`:
```xml
<add key="GeminiAPIKey" value="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" />
```
